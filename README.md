# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning.
Face &amp; Eye Detection: Uses OpenCV and Haar cascades/DNN for face and eye tracking.  Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) / Blink Detection: Detects eye closure over time to infer drowsiness.  Alert Mechanism: Sounds an alarm if drowsiness is detected.  ML Integration: Can be extended with classifiers (SVM, CNN) trained on drowsiness datasets.
